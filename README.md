# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Human-Activity-Monitoring-Data
In this project I analyzed the walking, running, climbing down, climbing up data of 15 subjects to extract time series features. 
Developed scatter plots for all activities using Natural and Horizontal Visibility Graphs.


The above dataset provides human activity data for 15 subjects. Click on each subject to
access the time series data. For this project I have considered the accelerometer data for all the 15
subjects for walking, running, climbing up and climbing down.

Performed tasks are as follows:

1. Applied natural visibility graph (NVG) and horizontal visibility graph (HVG) to the
aforementioned data
2. Computed the average degree, network diameter, and average path length
3. For the above computations, I have selected a sample size of 1024 data points ( from 1000
to 2024) for each of the 15 time series
4. Tabulated all the results
5. Generated  scatter plots: average degree vs network diameter and color the points
according to walking and running (do this for each accelerometer signal and
each method (HVH and NVG))
6. Generated  scatter plots: average degree vs network diameter and color the points
according to climbing up and climbing down (do this for each accelerometer
signal and each method (HVH and NVG))
